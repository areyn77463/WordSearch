# WordSearch
Wordsearch currently adds words to an empty 10x10 board at random. It will check to make sure the word will fit in each direction before placing. Will also check collision and if a word collides with another it will check if the letter on which it collides matches. If the letters do not match it will choose a different direction.
*Need to add error catching
*Need to add cli arguments for board size and word list
*Need to add a catch for words not able to fit on board
**Could add backtracking and forward checking to make sure words don't fit and try a rearrange to fit all words on board
